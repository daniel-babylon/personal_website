title: 'About'

---

I was born in Minas Gerais, a Brazilian region well known for its great coffee, cheese and their talkative inhabitants. 

Is my birthplace and a considerable influence on my personality. The curiosity and the flair for exploration of its people is something I am proud to carry. 

I am usually travelling in the direction of new challenges. In the last ten years, I have lived in six different cities. The most interesting one was for sure, Marabá, in the legal Amazon. My favourite one is still Brasília, capital of Brazil. 

Culture, language and food are subjects I can spend hours talking about. I thrive with complexity, but my goal is always to bring clarity and simplicity.  I can simplify anything: a process, a service, a digital experience or an organization. 

I am a self-taught design generalist. I am usually excited about learning new things and making connections across disciplines. I consider myself an Information Architect and Design Researcher. But I have worked as a Creative Director, Content Strategist, UX Lead, Planner and Community Manager. 

Currently, I am leading the Design Operations practice at Babylon Health. We are creating accessible and affordable healthcare for the world.

I  live in the UK, with my lovely and talented wife, Leiliane Valadares.
