For the first time in weeks, I started to write this essay on Friday. Publishing online is changing the dynamics of writing habits.

This week I will recommend a blog instead of a random weeknote. Allison Coward is a British entrepreneur and master of collaboration and facilitation. You will find [fantastic articles about collaboration and workshop facilitation](https://www.bracketcreative.co.uk/blog/) in her blog. And buy her book, she is awesome. 

# Good Things

## Adoptions, bets and the week in Product

We are mid-sprint, and release notes are ready for the next two releases. Reaffirming our ways of working and having new contributors joining us is excellent. From a product perspective, we have been doing well. Adoption is happening. Teams are now reaching out to start using our design system. In one of these conversations, I had to find the original investment proposal for DNA. It was good to reread it and reflect on the progress and how we shaped our initial bets. Product Management in systems feels like an infinite game of Tetris, but it has some good moments as well.

But change is coming. Elliot Greaves, our talented engineer, is leaving in 2 months. He was my third hire on that team and a pivotal reason for our success. I will miss his work ethics, collaboration skills, curiosity and devotion to make everything great. And his Jira mastery.

## Content first, please

My week was full of great content surprises. It started with some good work sessions with Linsey, Chris Brunner and Kevin.

And I attended the Content guild chapter offsite, Content Day. A great session with two external speakers. Smooth facilitation by our Rahel 'Content Empress' Bailie. She rocked, even with the usual Zoom crashesâ€”good learning about localisation, and exciting conversations about readability score methodologies, personality types and team shapes.

## Learned things

### The balance on structure and participation

Had a few challenges while facilitating sessions this week. Lessons learned: I need to be more patient. And be more intentional about clarifying structure, agenda and the role of facilitation. 

### Peer mentoring

I've met a design leader this week that I respect a lot. He is sharp, honest and a great communicator. We have shared interest in many things and similar challenges in working in scale-ups.

We discussed many topics. Remote work, agile, designers becoming product people. And the ethical challenges for design in late capitalism.

It was an open and honest conversation. Talking with someone that doesn't have skin in the same game as you is helpful. Perspective is a blessing. He reminded me that what matters is to have fun and enjoy the work.

### Agile, Design and Strategy

Designers have their brains wired with the double diamond. Navigating ambiguity, politics and possible futures is part of their skillset. Engineers love to discuss ways of solving a specific problem. Developers prefer to start with clarity: what we can ship and iterate. Delivery focus is risk mitigation, and this doesn't give much space for invention. So each discipline has its planning processes and expectations about vision.

We tend to see the world through our discipline lens and bias. For the business as usual, all things I described are just typical daily challenges, and it's ok to disagree. Product leaders create the balancing act.

When creating a strategy, alignment is a need. In the book Intertwingled, Peter Morville shared why this can be hard sometimes:

> We plan events, trips, families, sites, systems, companies, and cities. We do it all the time but make the same mistakes. First, we procrastinate. We fear complexity, so we start too late. Then, in a hurry, we split ideas and execution into phases or roles. We draw lines in our minds that segregate. The binary oppositions of think-do and plan-build are myths. Like yin and yang, these seemingly separate forces interrelated and entangled.

There are many ways. But there is no [Way of Ways](https://medium.com/@johnpcutler/the-way-of-ways-6988b272bcc5), unfortunately.

A strategy is a beast - you have to find the joy of not knowing things. And accept that you will be wrong, no matter how smart you think you are. Optimism isn't optional.

## Things that bring me joy

### Valentines Day with her

12th of June is Valentines in Brazil. I forgot to buy flowers, and Leili was a bit disappointed. But we danced, drank gin and laughed and cried watching This is Us.

### Tai-chi

I am practising Tai-chi for about a month now. The choreography is more natural for me, and I can focus on breathing and slowing down my movements. It's remarkable how this exercise disconnects me from the world.

### Discovering the BBC catalogue

After a long time, I finally decided to pay for a TV license. I could not see much value before, as I have many streaming options and not enough time. But I could not afford not to watch Killing Eve. I asked #lazytwitter recommendations for BBC shows, and I got some great suggestions from Dr Rosie and a Brazilian friend. [1][3]

### Healthcheck

Some pain in the back and neck, due to ergonomic problems in my home office setup. Meditation and painkillers helped me with this.

**Weight:** 98.5 kg
**Food:** Some junk food but not too many
**Drinks:** A gin
**Smoking:** 12 Juul pods. Trialling CBD.

1.  Here is the list of suggested BBC shows: Inside Number 9, Happy Valley, Devs, Line of Duty, Peaky Blinders and Gavin & Stacey are now on my watchlist.
