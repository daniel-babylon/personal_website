A short update about this week.

## Good things

### Sprint 3, Marie Curie

DNA team rocket my boat again as we keep recovering our momentum. Despite the immense complexity of the work, it is clear how much we evolved this week in terms of internal coherence. It was a joy to observe all things getting together, sliced and groomed in sprints. The sprint goal is crystal clear: to improve access to our accessibility documentation for developers, designers and QA Analysts. To get there, we will revamp the Information Architecture and enhance the way we create and store content. I am thrilled about this!

Another thing that made me happy was the last update in our component library, with no breaking changes in production and maintaining the accessibility improvements.

In our design system weekly meet-up, we had significant progress with design tokens. And excellent attendance and contribution from designers and developers.

### **ZoomVJ**

Everyone is spending a lot of time in zoom meetings. But I'm trying to make every encounter an opportunity for enjoyment as I am improving my facilitation skills. The job is enabling good conversations, deep listening and structure. Facilitation can guarantee that hard conversations are happening. This week was positive, and I felt I'm doing a good job.

Next week I will share with the team a short talk about practical workshops. I am glad it will be an opportunity to share what I have been learning about facilitation.

### **Unexpected 1–1 with Dr Hu**

Sophy Hu is a young, talented British doctor. I have a deep respect for her work. Like me, she is a generalist. She writes, designs and she gets AI in healthcare like a handful of people in the UK. We had a long, joyful conversation about work and many other things. Sophy's sense of humour is incredible. I always learn something new about Babylon when talking with her - she is one of the first 100 Babylonians. We talked about productivity, how doctors take notes, strategy and the best cities in the UK for hipsters.

## Learned things

### **Spotting the pattern**

I thought that things could not be worse, but humanity managed to screw up even harder. Millions are protesting in the streets due to structural racism and police brutality. And this probably will make the second wave unmanageable.

The past few days have been very hard for me. Not only because of what is happening in the US, but also because of the scenario in my country. Black people are dying by COVID at almost three times the rate of white people in the US. In Brazil, it is five times. The indigenous population is being decimated not only by COVID but by farmers destroying the Amazon. And the president is a racist, homophobic buffoon.

I caught myself worrying too much, crying and denying this reality. Spotting the worrying wave at the beginning was essential for me. I've found relief with therapy, talking with friends and listening again an audiobook Amy Hupe recommended.

## Things that bring me joy

### **Getting to know about my origins**

I messaged my father this week to understand a bit more about my blackness. My raw question: "What about our ancestors?". He shared a picture and the story of my great-grandfather, Bernardino. Bernardino was a son of freed slaves, who joined the army to fight against Lampião. I am now really excited to dig his story with my father.

### **Brazilian literature**

I've found a piece of article news about [Machado de Assis](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/07/09/hes-one-of-brazils-greatest-writers-why-isnt-machado-de-assis-more-widely-read) and the successful launch of his book in the US. He is the most famous Brazilian writer. He was also the founder of the Brazilian Academy of Letters. That got me in a beautiful rabbit hole searching about his life. I found this paper about his [work, racial identity and racism](http://www.psupress.org/books/titles/978-0-271-05246-5.html).

He was in a very shitty situation. He needed to protect his job and love for literature while writing about an unfair society:

> Some of his contemporaries criticised Machado for not writing more openly about the evils of slavery. And yet, for the grandson of freed slaves writing for a predominantly slave-owning elite, we are left in little doubt about what a controversial and sensitive subject it was for Machado, or where his sympathies lay.

Machado was so important and famous that he was not considered a black person by the elite. Until recently, his official [photos was whitewashed](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/14/books/brazil-machado-de-assis.html).

I had a great conversation about his books and Brazilian literature with Leili. We both read many of his books. It was a joy to remember classics like Dom Casmurro and Memórias Póstumas de Brás Cubas. The book The Collected Stories of Machado de Assis is a good start if you are interested.

### **Healthcheck**
