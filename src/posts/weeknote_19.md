A short update about this week. This edition is full of non-work. Views are my own. 

## Good things

### Sprint 3, Marie Curie

DNA team rocket my boat again this week. Despite the immense complexity of the work, it is clear how much we evolved this week in terms of internal coherence. It was a joy to observe all things getting together, sliced and groomed in sprints. The sprint goal is crystal clear: to improve access to our accessibility documentation for developers, designers and QA Analysts. To get there, we will revamp the Information Architecture and enhance the way we create and store content. I am thrilled about this!

Another good news: our component library was updated this week, with no breaking changes in production and maintaining the accessibility improvements.

In our design system weekly meet-up, we had significant progress with design tokens. And excellent attendance and contribution from designers and developers. 

### **ZoomVJ**

Everyone is spending a lot of time in zoom meetings. But I'm trying to make every encounter an opportunity for enjoyment as I am improving my facilitation skills. The job is enabling good conversations, deep listening and structure. Facilitation can guarantee that hard conversations are happening. This week was positive, and I felt I'm doing a good job.

Next week I will share with the team a short talk about practical workshops. I am glad it will be an opportunity to share what I have been learning about facilitation.

### **Unplanned 1–1 with Dr Hu**

Sophy Hu is a young, talented British doctor. I have a deep respect for her work. Like me, she is a generalist. She writes, designs and she gets AI in healthcare like a handful of people in the UK. We had a long, joyful conversation about work and many other things. Sophy's sense of humour is incredible. I always learn something new about Babylon when talking with her - she is one of the first 100 Babylonians. We talked about productivity, how doctors take notes, strategy and the best cities in the UK for hipsters.

## Learned things

### **Spotting the pattern**

I thought that things could not be worse, but humanity managed to screw up even harder. Millions are protesting in the streets due to structural racism and police brutality. And this probably will make the second wave unmanageable.

The past few days have been very hard for me. Not only because of what is happening in the US, but also because of the scenario in my country. Black people are dying by COVID at almost three times the rate of white people in the US. In Brazil, it is five times. The indigenous population is being decimated not only by COVID but by farmers destroying the Amazon. And the president is a racist, homophobic buffoon.

I caught myself worrying too much and even crying sometimes. The learning for me is that when you spot your monkey brain trying to take over, you can fight back. I've found relief with therapy, talking with friends and listening again an audiobook recommended by Amy Hupe:

### **Place of Speech, Standpoint Theory and the Black leaders I follow** 

In Brazilian Portuguese, we have an expression: "Lugar de Fala". The meaning is weakly represented in the academic circles in Standpoint Theory. Short version is: 

> A standpoint is a place from which we view the world that determines what we focus on as well as what we don't know. The social groups we belong to shape how we see the world and how we communicate societal inequalities generate distinctive accounts of the world

Interestingly, you will not find any mention or references to the Brazilian black author [Djamila Ribeiro's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Djamila_Ribeiro) original concept in the English wikipedia. \
\
A shortcut to understand Place of Speech is to explore related concepts. The Spiral of silence is one to read:

> individuals have a fear of isolation. This fear of isolation consequently leads to remaining silent instead of voicing opinions.

Many people will not feel in a position to talk about racism and Black Lives Matter. Besides being a person of colour, I don't think is  my place of speech. I have too many privileges: I am a male, educated, employed and living in a posh neighbourhood.\
Things are relatively easy for me. A few times I have been affected by racism, but I have never been beaten by a cop. \
\
I admit that I am confused and sad. There is a lot of identity issues going on my head now. I don't know yet if there is a right/wrong way of engaging in this subject. But complete silent is not an option. I am educating myself, donating and trying to keep my mouth shut. If you want to educate yourself I recommend following the amazing black women who are in the front lines of this debate and speaking truth to power on the web: \

## Things that bring me joy

### **Brazilian literature**

I've found a piece of article news about [Machado de Assis](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/07/09/hes-one-of-brazils-greatest-writers-why-isnt-machado-de-assis-more-widely-read) and the successful launch of his book in the US. He is the most famous Brazilian writer. He was also the founder of the Brazilian Academy of Letters. That got me in a beautiful rabbit hole searching about his life. I found this paper about his [work, racial identity and racism](http://www.psupress.org/books/titles/978-0-271-05246-5.html).

He was in a very shitty situation. He needed to protect his job and love for literature while writing about an unfair society:

> Some of his contemporaries criticised Machado for not writing more openly about the evils of slavery. And yet, for the grandson of freed slaves writing for a predominantly slave-owning elite, we are left in little doubt about what a controversial and sensitive subject it was for Machado, or where his sympathies lay.

Machado was so important and famous that he was not considered a black person by the elite. Until recently, his official [photo was whitewashed](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/14/books/brazil-machado-de-assis.html).

I had a great conversation about his books and Brazilian literature with Leili. We both read many of his books. It was a joy to remember classics like Dom Casmurro and Memórias Póstumas de Brás Cubas. The book The Collected Stories of Machado de Assis is a good start if you are interested.

### **Getting to know about my origins**

![Bernardino - Picture of  a Brazilian, with a beautiful tie and nice moustache](/images/photo-2020-06-04-14-17-18.jpg "Bernardino")

I messaged my father this week to understand a bit more about my blackness. My raw question: "What about our ancestors?". He shared a picture and the story of my great-grandfather, Bernardino. Bernardino was a son of freed slaves, who joined the army to fight against Lampião. I am now really excited to dig his story with my father.

### **Healthcheck**

**Weight:** 97 kg \
**Food:** 3 days of eating Deliveroo food. Some good bits. Too much sugar\
**Drinks:** A glass of wine\
**Smoking:** 15 Juul pods.

## Quote of the week

A champion is defined not by their wins, but by how many times they recover when they fall.
