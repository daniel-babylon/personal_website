## Good things


### **On track**

This week I was very proud of the DNA team. Managing the immense complexity of design systems work is not easy. But internal coherence is the real challenge. It was a joy to see the small things getting together, sliced in a sprint that we named Marie Curie. The goal is to improve our accessibility documentation. The entire team is excited to play with Information Architecture, and I am thrilled about it. I have also learned a lot about Jira with Elliot and Fred.  


### **ZoomVJ**

If I could rewrite my mission in Design Operations today, I would say that is enabling good conversations. With individuals, is about deep listening. With groups, is about facilitation and making sure the hard conversations are happening. This week was successful, and I felt that I am doing a good job. 

Next week I will share with the team a short talk about practical workshops, and I am glad that I volunteered for it. Facilitation is a great skill, and I am happy that I can contribute with this. 


### **Unexpected 1–1 with Dr Hu**

Sophy Hu is a work colleague that I respect a lot. Like me, she is a generalist. She is a trained doctor, writer, designer, and she gets AI in healthcare like a handful of people in the UK. I have the pleasure to work with her in our chapter. We had a long, joyful conversation about work and many other things. Sophy’s sense of humour is incredible. I always learn something new about Babylon when talking with her - she is one of the first 100 Babylonians. We talked about productivity, how doctors take notes, strategy and the best cities in the UK for hipsters. 


## Learned things


### **Spotting the pattern**

It was a very intense week at work. And amidst a global pandemic, humanity managed to screw up even harder. Millions are protesting in the streets due to structural racism. And this will make the second wave unmanageable. 

So the past few days have been very hard for me. Not only because of what is happening in the US, but also because of the scenario in my country. Black people are dying by COVID at almost three times the rate of white people in the US. In Brazil, it is five times. The indigenous population is being decimated not only by COVID but by farmers destroying the Amazon. And the president is a racist, homophobic buffoon.

I caught myself worrying too much, crying, denying this reality. 

Spotting the worrying wave at the beginning was essential for me. I’ve found relief with therapy, talking with friends and listening again an audiobook Amy Hupe recommended.

Self-awareness and self-care are tools for a less stressful life - but you need relentless practice and discipline. Never let your monkey brain dominate you. 


## Things that bring me joy


### **Getting to know about my origins**

When I moved to the UK, I thought that I would be less affected by structural racism or bias. Boy, I was wrong. I have plenty of privilege - a caring family, a career, and I am male. But dealing with the effects of implicit bias is still part of my life. It triggers uncomfortable memories every time. As an immigrant, I don’t feel entitled to protest. 

All of this got me thinking about my origins and blackness. I messaged my father to understand this more. He shared a picture and the story of my great-grandfather, Bernardino. Bernardino was a son of freed slaves, who joined the army to fight against Lampião. I am so excited to get to know more about him with my father. 


### **Brazilian literature**

I’ve found some news about [Machado de Assis](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/07/09/hes-one-of-brazils-greatest-writers-why-isnt-machado-de-assis-more-widely-read). He is the most famous Brazilian writer. He was also the founder of the Brazilian Academy of Letters. That got me in a beautiful rabbit hole searching about his life. I found this paper about his [work, racial identity and racism](http://www.psupress.org/books/titles/978-0-271-05246-5.html). 

He was in a very shitty situation. He needed to protect his job and love for literature while writing about an unfair society:

> Machado was criticised by some of his contemporaries for not writing more openly about the evils of slavery. And yet, for the grandson of freed slaves writing for a predominantly slave-owning elite, we are left in little doubt about what a controversial and sensitive subject it was for Machado, or where his sympathies lay. 

Machado was so successful that he was not considered a black person by the elite. Until recently, his official [photos were whitewashed](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/14/books/brazil-machado-de-assis.html). 

I had a great conversation about his books and Brazilian literature with Leili. We both read many of his books. It was a joy to remember classics like Dom Casmurro and Memórias Póstumas de Brás Cubas. The book The Collected Stories of Machado de Assis is a good start if you are interested. 


### **Healthcheck**
